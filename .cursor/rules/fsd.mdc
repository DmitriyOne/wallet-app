## FSD: Feature Sliced Design — Developer Briefing

Feature Sliced Design (FSD) is an architectural methodology for front-end applications where the product is divided into **independent, self-sufficient components** — "slices." Each slice is developed independently, ensuring **high modularity, flexibility, and scalability** of the project.

---

### Key Benefits and Goals

* **Isolation of Errors and Changes:** Modifying code in one "slice" has minimal impact on others, reducing the risk of regressions.
* **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Every module/directory has a strictly defined role, simplifying onboarding and navigation.
* **Scalability:** Suitable for large teams and long-term projects, allowing parallel work on different features without conflict.
* **Encapsulation:** The internal logic of a feature is hidden, enabling easy changes to its implementation without affecting its consumers.

### Clarification of Abstraction Levels (Layers)

The directory structure represents the FSD layers, which dictate the direction of dependencies (the **"Top-to-Bottom"** rule). 

| Layer | Purpose | Dependencies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **src/01\_app/** | **Application Initialization** (Root components, routing, global providers). | Depends on all layers below. |
| **src/02\_pages/** | **Pages** (Composition of widgets and features to form the view of an entire page). | Depends on `widgets/`, `features/`, `entities/`, `shared/`. |
| **src/03\_widgets/** | **Independent and Self-contained Blocks** (Large UI blocks that can appear on different pages, e.g., Header, Sidebar, Shopping Cart). | Depends on `features/`, `entities/`, `shared/`. |
| **src/04\_features/** | **User Scenario Processing** (Business logic that the user can initiate: "Sign In," "Place Order," "Submit Form"). | Depends on `entities/`, `shared/`. |
| **src/05\_entities/** | **Business Entities and Domain Logic** (Description of the subject area: "User," "Product," "Order"). | Depends **only** on `shared/`. |
| **src/06\_shared/** | **Reusable Modules** (Low-level, non-business-specific: UI components, utilities, common types, API clients). | Has **No Dependencies** on other FSD layers. |

### Strict Dependency Rule

**The Main FSD Rule:** Dependencies can **only** be directed **Top-to-Bottom** (from a higher level of abstraction to a lower one).

* ✅ `pages` can import from `features`.
* ❌ `features` **cannot** import from `pages` or `widgets`.
* ✅ `entities` can import from `shared`.

Adhering to this rule ensures that the lower levels remain reusable and are not dependent on the specific context of their usage.
